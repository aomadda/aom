                          There is no need to strictly construe the words &quot;public safety&quot; laid down in section.19 of the Indian Railways Act. A Level crossing is to be manned twenty-four hours by railway employee on duty at the gate. It has been submitted that since the railway administration has met fifty percent of the expenditure on the flyover it would be in the interest of public exchequer to so construct the flyover as to totally avoid placement on duty for twenty four hours of railway employees at the level crossing. It is with this view that sub-way is being provided and is being constructed and a wall is being constructed on both sides of the subway so as to prevent flow of traffic over the railway line and to obviate the need of level crossing gate on the railway line.
